# Parts V1

This application will provide a directory of LEGOÂ® colours, parts, and sets. Quite similar to [Brick Owl](https://www.brickowl.com/) and [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/). The app will collect the original data from the [Rebrickable API](https://rebrickable.com/api/).

> The live website is available at:  
> https://parts.brickmmo.com

## Project Stack

This application will intentionally be written in a simplified structure with a simple stack. This will provide BrickMMO developers with a simple application to contribute to once they have some understanding of server-side languages such as PHP.
